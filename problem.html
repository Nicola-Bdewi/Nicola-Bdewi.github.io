							<h1>The Problem</h1>
							<p>Canadian seniors are depending on technology more than ever. According to Statistics Canada [1], around 82% of people who are aged 65 years and older use the internet and different apps for booking appointments, reading news,or staying in touch with other people. </p>
              <p>During the circumstances that happened when COVID-19 hit, elderly people were advised to stay home to isolate themselves in order to not catch the virus. There were concerns regarding the mental and physical health as a result of the isolation. </p>
							<p>Elderly individuals struggled to navigate how to keep up with their health concerns as physical accessibility to resources and professionals became minimized and connection via online platforms emerged [5]. Additionally, feelings of isolation, depression, and hopelessness further deteriorated health conditions for many [4].</p>
							<h1>Competitors: </h1>
							<p>1) Medisafe Medication Reminder </p>
							<p><b>Intentions:</b></p>
							<p>Helps users manage medication schedules and reminds them when it's time to take their medications.</p>
							<p><b>Problems:</b></p>
							<ul>
							  <li>Overwhelming Information: Users, particularly the elderly, may struggle to enter all of their drugs correctly and become overwhelmed by the amount of information required.</li>
							  <li>Lack of personalizing: While the software does allow for some customization, customers with several health concerns may find it lacks the level of customizing needed to handle complex drug regimes.</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<p>2)Carer - Healthcare for Elderly</p>
							<p><b>Intentions:</b></p>
							<p>To provide comprehensive healthcare assistance to the elderly, focusing on simplifying healthcare management, enhancing accessibility to medical services, and improving the quality of life for older adults.</p>
							<p><b>Problems:</b></p>
							<ul>
							  <li>Complex Interface: The elderly may find a complex app interface difficult to navigate, especially if they are not tech-savvy. An app that combines multiple functionalities, while beneficial, could be intimidating or confusing.</li>
							  <li>Data Privacy Concerns: Handling sensitive health information requires stringent data protection measures. Users may be concerned about how their data is stored and used.</li>
							</ul>

							<h1>Conclusion</h1>
							<p>We learned that understanding the user’s perspective of the app is the most important part of the design of UIs. It directly affects the development of the whole app since every single aspect of the app is concerned with the user’s preferences. </p>
							<p>What is more, the challenging parts were that we had to find enough space because of the big size of every component we have. And the other one is the way we collected data about the elderly people and how they would like an app like that.</p>
							<p>After conducting our research and having multiple failed designs, the team was able to come up with such an app that satisfies the results of our research and feedback received from the future users. </p>
