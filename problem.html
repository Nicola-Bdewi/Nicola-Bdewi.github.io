							<h1>The Problem</h1>
							<p>Canadian seniors are depending on technology more than ever. According to Statistics Canada [1], around 82% of people who are aged 65 years and older use the internet and different apps for booking appointments, reading news,or staying in touch with other people. </p>
              <p>During the circumstances that happened when COVID-19 hit, elderly people were advised to stay home to isolate themselves in order to not catch the virus. There were concerns regarding the mental and physical health as a result of the isolation. </p>
							<p>Elderly individuals struggled to navigate how to keep up with their health concerns as physical accessibility to resources and professionals became minimized and connection via online platforms emerged [5]. Additionally, feelings of isolation, depression, and hopelessness further deteriorated health conditions for many [4].</p>
